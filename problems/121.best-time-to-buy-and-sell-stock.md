# Question
## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the `ith` element is the price of a given stock on day `i`.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Slowâ€¦ :thinking:


```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
const maxProfit = prices => {
  if (prices.length === 1) return 0
  let profit = [0]
  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    const buyPrice = prices[i]
    for (let j = i; j < prices.length; j++) {
      if (prices[j] > buyPrice) {
        profit.push(prices[j] - buyPrice)
      }
    }
  }
  return Math.max(...profit)
}
```

# Answer from LeetCode

Minimum number matters. Once you get that, all you need to do is to get then maximum difference bettween the minimum number and the others.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
const maxProfit = prices => {
  let minprice = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  let maxprofit = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] < minprice) {
      minprice = prices[i];
    } else if (prices[i] - minprice > maxprofit) {
      maxprofit = prices[i] - minprice;
    }
  }
  return maxprofit;
}
```
