# Question
## Maximum Subarray

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

:bulb: You don't have to make a array, just need a **sum**.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
const maxSubArray = (nums) => {
  if (nums.length == 0) return 0
  if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0]
  
  let score = nums[0]
  let maxScore =  score
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    score += nums[i]
      
    if (nums[i] > score) {
      score = nums[i]
    }
    if (maxScore < score) {
      maxScore = score
    }
    console.log({maxScore})
  }
  return maxScore
}
```
