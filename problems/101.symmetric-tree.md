# Question
## Symmetric Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]` is not:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

# My answer

This is the first time to deal with Binary tree and I couldn't solve this :cry:

# Answer from LeetCode
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const isSymmetric = (root) => {
  return isMirror(root, root)
}

const isMirror = (t1, t2) => {
  if (t1 === null && t2 === null) return true
  if (t1 == null || t2 == null) return false
  
  return (t1.val == t2.val)
    && isMirror(t1.right, t2.left)
    && isMirror(t1.left, t2.right);
}
```
