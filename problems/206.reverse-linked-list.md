I couldn't solve this :cry:

# Answer from LeetCode

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
const reverseList = (head) => {
  let prev = null
  let current = head
  while (current !== null) {
    const nextTemp = current.next
    current.next = prev
    prev = current
    current = nextTemp
  }
  return prev
}
```
