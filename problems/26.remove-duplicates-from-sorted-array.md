# Question
## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** in-place with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**
```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
const removeDuplicates = (nums) => {
  deleteDup(nums, 0)
  return nums.lengh
}

const deleteDup = (arr, index = 0) => {
  for (let i = index; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] !== arr[i + 1]) {
      continue
    }
    arr.splice(i, 1)
    deleteDup(arr, i)
  } 
}
```

ðŸ’¡You just need to know how many unique integer does `nums` have. **You don't have to make duplicate-removed array**.


```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
const removeDuplicates = (nums) => {
  if (nums.length == 0) return 0
  let i = 0;
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
      }
  }
  return i + 1;
}
```
