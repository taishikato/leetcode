## Linked List Cycle
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
```
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
```
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

## Approach 1: Hash Table

This is the easiest approach I assume. Understandable.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const hasCycle = function(head) {
  const nodesSeen = []
  while (head !== null) {
    if (nodesSeen.indexOf(head) > -1) {
      return true
    } else {
      nodesSeen.push(head);
    }
    head = head.next;
  }
  return false
}
```

## Approach 2: Two Pointers

This is a very smart way to solve it!!

```javascript
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const hasCycle = function(head) {
  const nodesSeen = []
  while (head !== null) {
    if (nodesSeen.indexOf(head) > -1) {
      return true
    } else {
      nodesSeen.push(head);
    }
    head = head.next;
  }
  return false
}
```
